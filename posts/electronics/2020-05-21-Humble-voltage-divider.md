Two resistors connected in series. It doesn't get any simpler than that. Pus some voltage in and get less voltage out. 

## Thévenin's equivalent

Students typically learn about Thévenin's equivalent in their first course on electronics and then quickly forget about it. It is, however, a useful tool to simplify electronic circuit analysis. You can bundle a big part of a circuit and see how it interacts with everything else. 

## Input and output impedance

- Few different values for the same ratio vs. Thévenin resistance
- High/low output impedance

## Voltage regulators

- LM1117-ADJ
- How to set output voltage
- R2/R1 Ratio
- Practical resistor values
- Minimum output current
- Thévenin equivalent of the voltage divider
- Impact of adj pin current
- Possible noise issues
- Output impedance of a voltage regulator

## Choosing the right resistors

- E6/E12/E24 series
